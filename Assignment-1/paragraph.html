      <h1> <em> Does high turnout mean new voting laws did not suppress votes?  </em> </h1>
<p>
  <strong>WOLF</strong>: Can we now assume that because of the high turnout in certain states and because so many people were making use of early voting, that some of those concerns about restrictive new voting laws were unfounded?

  <strong>MCDONALD</strong>: I’ll give you a silly and completely ludicrous response to that. But there’s a point to it. You know what this election is? I see massive voter suppression happening in this election.

  I look back at the <em>2020</em> presidential election and turnout is down across the board in every state. There has been massive voter suppression in this election.

  Of course, you think that that’s ludicrous. It’s laughable because people vote in higher rates in presidential elections than midterm elections.

  And just because you’re having an interesting race pulling people out to vote in a state like Georgia, that doesn’t mean that SB 202, which is the law that was passed in Georgia, somehow has made it easier for everyone to vote in the state. That does not mean that there’s certain communities that have not been left behind.

  A good example of this, if you look at Georgia, is although we’re seeing record numbers of in-person, early voters, we’re seeing the mail ballots decreased by about half. And you may say, well, that’s OK. People who would have voted by mail, they’re just going to vote in person or they will vote on Election Day or early.

  There could be some people who, for whatever reason, are home-ridden, and they are unable to make it to a polling location, and they must vote a mail ballot. And for those people, it may be that they are unable to participate to the same degree that other people in Georgia have been.

  I’m not gonna say that just because there’s high early voting turnout going on in Georgia that means that the law had no suppressive effect for any particular community in Georgia.

      Will turnout continue to rise?
<strong>WOLF</strong>: Will turnout in <em>2022</em> eclipse the <em>2018</em> midterm?

<strong>MCDONALD</strong>: We’re gonna see high turnout. Georgia probably will eclipse their <em> 2018 </em>turnout. And other some other states like Pennsylvania might.

But it’s very possible that we’re not going to see the same level of engagement in some of the larger states like California, New York and Texas. And since most of the population lives in those large states and they don’t have the competitive elections that are pulling turnout, we may see some unevenness.

I don’t expect it to revert all the way back to 2014. That was the lowest turnout election since <em>1942</em>. But I would not be surprised if we’re below 2018.
