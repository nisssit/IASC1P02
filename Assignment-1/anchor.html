      Canada is officially making its first appearance on the FIFA World Cup stage in 36 years.

  The Canadian squad will participate in the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, marking the first time since 1986 the country has qualified to participate on soccer’s biggest stage after topping CONCACAF qualifying standings.

  Canada, No. 41 in FIFA’s men’s world ranking, will play in Group F at the World Cup, with matches against Belgium, Morocco, and Croatia. Belgium is ranked No. 2, and lost to France in the semi-final four years ago. Croatia is ranked No. 12 and was a surprise World Cup finalist in 2018. Morocco is ranked No. 22.


  Fans looking to root on Canada from afar will need to turn to TSN for their viewing pleasures. Bell Media holds the rights to broadcast the soccer showcase in Canada, and will do so via TSN — their biggest sports property.

  That means those with TSN in their cable package can catch plenty of World Cup action. Viewers with CTV in their cable package will also be able to view select games, including each of Canada’s matches.

  Those without cable can still catch every match live on the TSN App, according to TSN. A monthly pass costs $19.99 plus tax, and an annual pass runs $199.90 plus tax for 12 months.

  The group phase begins on November 20 and will be played through December 2. The knockout phase will begin with the Round of 16 on December 3 and run through December 6. The quarterfinals will be played on December 9 and 10, with the semifinals set for December 13 and 14.

  The final will played on December 18.

  The 64 tournament matches will take place across eight venues, including Al Bayt Stadium, Al Thumama Stadium, Al Janoub Stadium, Ahmad Bin Ali Stadium, Education City Stadium, Lusail Stadium, Stadium 974, and Khalifa International Stadium.

    The FIFA World Cup will feature a 32-team group stage featuring eight groups of four countries. The top two countries from each group will advance down to the field of 16. Those 16 teams will advance into the single-game knockout stage which will see the winner advance and the loser eliminated.

  A winner must be declared for each knockout-round match, and extra time and penalty kicks will be used to determine the victorious country, if necessary.

  The stage schedule is as follows:
